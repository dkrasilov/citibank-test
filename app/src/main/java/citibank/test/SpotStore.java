/**
 * Here is interface you need to implement.
 * Please use only single .java file for solution. Please make sure it can be compiled on Java 11 without
 * any additional steps and 3rd-party libs. Please use comments to describe your solution.
 * <p>
 * This is spot provider, it stores information about ticking spots, and provide ability to requests like : what was the spot
 * at any given point in time.
 * CCYPAIR  is combination of two 3chars currencies like "EURUSD" or "JPYRUB" and so on.  Always in uppercase.
 * SPOT is ticking value of given ccypair  like for "USDRUB" it can be 76.45 then 76.46 then 76.44 ...
 * <p>
 * We can assume that all data fits in memory, so we don't need to store it anywhere.
 * But there is a  "SUPER" task to have some persisting logic. It is not mandatory task. So, up to you.
 *
 * @ThreadSafe Please note that implementation should be thread safe. This methods are calling from a lot of threads.
 * <p>
 * Please don't spend more then one hour on this task.
 * And one more hour on "SUPER" task, if you are ready to spend this time on it.(not mandatory)
